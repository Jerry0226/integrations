### Rejected Optimize Requests

> The number of optimize requests that have been rejected on this node since it started. Superseded by `counter.thread_pool.rejected`.

If the optimize request queue fills up to its limit, new work units will begin to be rejected, and you will see that reflected in this rejected metric. This is often a sign that your cluster is starting to bottleneck on some resources, since a full queue means your node/cluster is processing at maximum speed but unable to keep up with the influx of work.
